# Security-Scripting-Challenge

As a Security Operations Engineer, you face the challenge of preventing Denial Of Services attacks from generating downtime in productive services. 

The alarm that monitors anamalous traffic is triggered and you need to respond to the incident. 

1. Get the information the traffic monitor provides via API.
   1.1 The monitor endpoint is the following: https://fbfac7f8-bafe-42c5-8c37-b1db396ab3ba.trayapp.io 
   1.2 This endpoint will return a url to download the csv with the vpc-flow-logs, only via Browser.

2. Analyze the content and determine how to block the traffic to stop the DOS attack.
  
3. Execute the chosen response tactic via API.
